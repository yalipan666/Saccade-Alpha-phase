# Saccade-Alpha-phase
Scripts sharing for the project ''Saccades are locked to the phase of alpha oscillations during natural reading''

We have deposited the following data in the current study on figshare (https://figshare.com/projects/Pan_etal_NatCom_2021/117885): the raw MEG data, the epoch data after pre-processing, the raw EyeLink files, the Psychotoolbox data, and the head models after the co-registration of T1 images with the MEG data. The raw T1 images are not shared due to sensitive personal information (faces). De-identifying T1 images will remove the informative facial landmarks and make it difficult to construct head models. Therefore, we share the head models instead of the T1 images. Any additional information will be available from the authors upon reasonable request. 

The folder 'PTB_codes' contains the Psychotoolbox scripts that used to present the one-line sentence on screen.
